I was looking to watch the documentary [No Other Land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Other_Land) — from the wiki:

> [No Other land] was recorded between 2019 and 2023 and shows the destruction of a Palestinian community in the occupied West Bank, which had been resisting forced displacement after an Israeli "firing zone" was declared on their land.

While not widely available for streaming, fortunately it's readily available on the Internet Archive — even one version seems to be [uploaded by Basel Adra](https://archive.org/details/nootherland_202503), one of the directors of the film.

So, how did I find it on [archive.org](https://archive.org)? Well, definitely not via Google Search.

Here's are the results if you search `No other land archive.org` on Google:

![No other land Google search](/images/NoL-gsearch1.jpg)
The first result is a song, but no sign of the film. Nothing on page 2, 3, 4, etc.

Let's give Google Search the benefit of the doubt by searching `"No Other Land" site:archive.org`

![No other land Google search specific](/images/NoL-gsearch2.jpg)

Still nothing, including the subsequent pages. Pivoting to searching with [duckduckgo.com](https://duckduckgo.com)

![No other land DDG search](/images/NoL-dsearch.jpg)

We get the film on the Internet Archive in the first result. Didn't even need to put the title in quotes or limit it to the domain via `site:` — and the region set didn't matter either.

By extension of duckduckgo, [Bing](https://www.bing.com/search?q=no+other+land+archive.org) also shows the film as the top result. Even [Yandex](https://yandex.com/search/?text=no+other+land+archive.org) shows the film at the top. However, [baidu.com](https://baidu.com) doesn't show the archive.org link.
